**Title:** Exception Request – Vendor JavaScript Libraries (DataTables, jqGrid, jQuery UI, jqModal, jqDnR, jQuery Form)

## 1. Executive Summary

GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) identified multiple JavaScript vulnerabilities across vendor-supplied libraries bundled in our application. These include DataTables Buttons, jqGrid, jQuery UI, jqModal, jqDnR, and jQuery Form.

We cannot modify these files directly without breaking vendor support or upgrade paths. We are requesting a time-bound exception, while engaging with the respective vendors/maintainers to provide upstream fixes.

## 2. Findings Overview

| # | File                    | Package            | GHAS Rule                      | Severity | Risk Summary                                                             |
| - | ----------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 1 | `dataTables.buttons.js` | DataTables Buttons | `js/bad-html-filtering-regexp` | High     | Regex used to strip HTML does not handle multiline → potential XSS.      |
| 2 | `buttons.colVis.js`     | DataTables Buttons | `js/bad-html-filtering-regexp` | High     | Same as above.                                                           |
| 3 | `jquery.jqGrid.js`      | jqGrid             | `js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`      | Medium   | `$()` called with unvalidated input; jQuery may interpret as HTML → XSS. |
| 4 | `jquery-ui.js`          | jQuery UI          | `js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`      | Medium   | Similar unsafe plugin usage.                                             |
| 5 | `jquery.form.js`        | jQuery Form        | `js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`      | Medium   | Insecure plugin calls.                                                   |
| 6 | `grid.base.js`          | jqGrid             | `js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`      | Medium   | Same issue.                                                              |
| 7 | `jqDnR.js`              | jqDnR              | `js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`      | Medium   | Insecure drag/resize plugin patterns.                                    |
| 8 | `jqModal.js`            | jqModal            | `js/unsafe-jquery-plugin`      | Medium   | `$.fn.jqmShow` uses `$()` with attacker-influenced inputs.               |
| 9 | `web.config`            | Application Config | Missing X-Frame-Options header | High     | App may be embedded in iframes → clickjacking risk.                      |

## 3. Why We Cannot Remediate In-Place

* All flagged files are **vendor libraries** (minified/bundled).
* Local modifications would:

  * Break vendor upgrade/support contracts.
  * Be overwritten on each package upgrade.
* No patched versions currently available.
* Fixes must be delivered upstream (vendors/DataTables, jqGrid, jQuery maintainers).

---

## 4. Technical Impact & Exploitability

* **Bad Regex in DataTables:** Could allow malicious multi-line comments/scripts to bypass stripping → XSS. Risk is low in our environment because inputs to DataTables come only from trusted backend APIs that already HTML-escape content.
* **Unsafe jQuery Plugins:** Passing user-controlled strings to `$()` could cause arbitrary HTML insertion. Exploitability is limited since our app does not expose these plugin calls to unauthenticated/untrusted user input.
* **Missing X-Frame-Options:** Clickjacking possible if application endpoints are embedded. However, the app already runs behind WAF and authentication.

---

## 5. Compensating Controls

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Strict `script-src 'self'` policy prevents inline scripts.
* **WAF Protections:** Block common XSS injection patterns.
* **Server-Side Escaping:** All backend API responses are HTML-encoded before rendering.
* **Authentication:** Affected components are not publicly exposed without login.
* **Monitoring:** Frontend logs (Sentry/Datadog) capture suspicious behavior.

---

## 6. Mitigation & Roadmap

**Immediate (in place):**

* Validate and escape data server-side before rendering.
* Monitor attempted exploit payloads.

**Short-term (30 days):**

* Submit issues/tickets to vendors:

  * DataTables (SpryMedia)
  * jqGrid (Guriddo)
  * jQuery Form / jqModal / jqDnR maintainers
* Track vendor responses.

**Medium-term (60–90 days):**

* Upgrade to patched vendor releases once available.
* If no vendor patch, evaluate replacement or local wrapper sanitization.

---

## 7. Requested Exception

* **Duration:** 90 days (2025-09-25 → 2025-12-25).
* **Condition:** Renewal only if vendor patches are pending and compensating controls remain in place.
* **Emergency Revocation:** If monitoring detects attempted exploitation, exception is revoked, and affected features disabled.

---

## 8. Testing & Verification

* Payload tests (e.g., `<!--\n<script>alert(1)</script>\n-->`, `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`) are blocked or escaped.
* CI/CD pipelines rerun GHAS scans; exception applies only to vendor files.
